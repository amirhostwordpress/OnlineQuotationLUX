# Corrected Pricing Structure Guide

## Overview

The pricing structure has been corrected to properly handle three distinct service levels. Each service level includes only the relevant costs, ensuring accurate and transparent pricing for customers.

## Service Levels and Cost Inclusion

### 1. Fabrication Only
**What's Included:**
- ✅ Material Cost (Luxone materials or customer-supplied)
- ✅ Sink Options (if selected)
- ❌ Basic Processing Costs (Cutting, Polishing, etc.)
- ❌ Optional Add-on Services
- ❌ Delivery
- ❌ Installation

**Example Calculation:**
```
Material: Golden River Quartz (280 AED/sqm)
Area: 4 sqm (2m × 2m)
Sink: Luxone Complete Package (900 AED)

Material Cost: 4 × 280 = 1,120 AED
Sink Cost: 900 AED
Subtotal: 1,120 + 900 = 2,020 AED
Company Profit (20%): 2,020 × 0.20 = 404 AED
Subtotal with Profit: 2,020 + 404 = 2,424 AED
VAT (5%): 2,424 × 0.05 = 121.20 AED
GRAND TOTAL: 2,424 + 121.20 = 2,545.20 AED
```

### 2. Fabrication & Delivery
**What's Included:**
- ✅ Material Cost (Luxone materials or customer-supplied)
- ✅ Sink Options (if selected)
- ✅ Delivery (location-based)
- ❌ Basic Processing Costs (Cutting, Polishing, etc.)
- ❌ Optional Add-on Services
- ❌ Installation

**Example Calculation:**
```
Material: Golden River Quartz (280 AED/sqm)
Area: 4 sqm (2m × 2m)
Sink: Luxone Complete Package (900 AED)
Location: Dubai

Material Cost: 4 × 280 = 1,120 AED
Sink Cost: 900 AED
Delivery: 500 AED (Dubai)
Subtotal: 1,120 + 900 + 500 = 2,520 AED
Company Profit (20%): 2,520 × 0.20 = 504 AED
Subtotal with Profit: 2,520 + 504 = 3,024 AED
VAT (5%): 3,024 × 0.05 = 151.20 AED
GRAND TOTAL: 3,024 + 151.20 = 3,175.20 AED
```

### 3. Fabrication, Delivery & Installation
**What's Included:**
- ✅ Material Cost (Luxone materials or customer-supplied)
- ✅ Sink Options (if selected)
- ✅ Delivery (location-based)
- ✅ Installation (80 AED/sqm)
- ✅ Basic Processing Costs (Cutting, Polishing, etc.)
- ✅ Optional Add-on Services (if selected)

**Example Calculation:**
```
Material: Golden River Quartz (280 AED/sqm)
Area: 4 sqm (2m × 2m)
Sink: Luxone Complete Package (900 AED)
Location: Dubai
Add-ons: Custom Edge (200 AED), Hob Cut Out (100 AED)

Material Cost: 4 × 280 = 1,120 AED
Basic Processing: 4 × (40 + 80 + 40) = 640 AED
Add-ons: 200 + 100 = 300 AED
Sink Cost: 900 AED
Delivery: 500 AED (Dubai)
Installation: 4 × 80 = 320 AED
Subtotal: 1,120 + 640 + 300 + 900 + 500 + 320 = 3,780 AED
Company Profit (20%): 3,780 × 0.20 = 756 AED
Subtotal with Profit: 3,780 + 756 = 4,536 AED
VAT (5%): 4,536 × 0.05 = 226.80 AED
GRAND TOTAL: 4,536 + 226.80 = 4,762.80 AED
```

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Files
1. **`src/utils/pricingCalculator.ts`**: Corrected calculation logic
2. **`src/components/admin/QuotationCostBreakdown.tsx`**: Updated display logic
3. **`src/components/QuoteSummary.tsx`**: Fixed color display

### Key Changes Made

#### Pricing Calculator (`pricingCalculator.ts`)
```typescript
// Processing costs ONLY for "Fabrication, Delivery & Installation"
if (data.serviceLevel === 'fabrication-delivery-installation') {
  cutting = totalSqm * 40;
  topPolishing = totalSqm * 80;
  polishing = totalSqm * 40;
  // Add-on services also only for this level
}

// Delivery for "Fabrication & Delivery" and "Fabrication, Delivery & Installation"
if (data.serviceLevel === 'fabrication-delivery' || 
    data.serviceLevel === 'fabrication-delivery-installation') {
  delivery = data.deliveryLocation === 'dubai' ? 500 : 800;
}

// Installation ONLY for "Fabrication, Delivery & Installation"
if (data.serviceLevel === 'fabrication-delivery-installation') {
  installation = totalSqm * 80;
}
```

#### Cost Breakdown Display (`QuotationCostBreakdown.tsx`)
```typescript
// Only show processing costs for "Fabrication, Delivery & Installation"
if (serviceLevel === 'fabrication-delivery-installation' && 
    ((pricing.cutting || 0) + (pricing.topPolishing || 0) + (pricing.polishing || 0)) > 0) {
  // Show processing costs
}

// Only show delivery for appropriate service levels
if ((serviceLevel === 'fabrication-delivery' || 
     serviceLevel === 'fabrication-delivery-installation') && 
    (pricing.delivery || 0) > 0) {
  // Show delivery costs
}
```

#### Color Display Fix (`QuoteSummary.tsx`)
```typescript
// Handle new multi-product structure for color display
{(() => {
  if (data.selectedProducts && data.selectedProducts.length > 0) {
    const colors = data.selectedProducts
      .map(product => product.materialColor)
      .filter(color => color && color.trim() !== '')
      .join(', ');
    return colors || 'TBC';
  }
  return data.materialColor || data.luxoneOthersColorName || 'TBC';
})()}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Fabrication Only
1. Select "Fabrication Only" service level
2. Choose Luxone material (Golden River, 280 AED/sqm)
3. Add pieces (2m × 2m = 4 sqm)
4. Select Luxone sink (900 AED)
5. **Expected**: Only material cost (1,120 AED) + sink (900 AED) = 2,020 AED subtotal

### Test Case 2: Fabrication & Delivery
1. Select "Fabrication & Delivery" service level
2. Choose Luxone material (Golden River, 280 AED/sqm)
3. Add pieces (2m × 2m = 4 sqm)
4. Select Luxone sink (900 AED)
5. Set location to Dubai
6. **Expected**: Material (1,120 AED) + sink (900 AED) + delivery (500 AED) = 2,520 AED subtotal

### Test Case 3: Fabrication, Delivery & Installation
1. Select "Fabrication, Delivery & Installation" service level
2. Choose Luxone material (Golden River, 280 AED/sqm)
3. Add pieces (2m × 2m = 4 sqm)
4. Select Luxone sink (900 AED)
5. Set location to Dubai
6. Add Custom Edge (200 AED) and Hob Cut Out (100 AED)
7. **Expected**: Material (1,120 AED) + processing (640 AED) + add-ons (300 AED) + sink (900 AED) + delivery (500 AED) + installation (320 AED) = 3,780 AED subtotal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Processing costs showing for Fabrication Only**: Check service level condition in pricing calculator
2. **Delivery not included**: Verify service level is "fabrication-delivery" or "fabrication-delivery-installation"
3. **Installation missing**: Ensure service level is "fabrication-delivery-installation"
4. **Color showing TBC**: Check multi-product structure handling in QuoteSummary

### Debug Steps
1. **Check Service Level**: Verify `data.serviceLevel` value
2. **Review Calculation Logic**: Ensure conditions match service level
3. **Validate Display Logic**: Check cost breakdown component conditions
4. **Test with Known Values**: Use test cases above to verify calculations
